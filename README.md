ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ : INSTINCTIVE MIND OBJECT DETECTION A PROXIA

*️⃣📶🤖

REQUIREMENTS: 

[*] Software Requirements: Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook, Python, Tensor Flow

[*] HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: fast TPU/GPU.

[*] DEPENDENCIES: INCLUDED


=============================================================

This is a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for (one possible scheme in) developing an OBJECT DETECTION proxia when working with ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ 
(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0™ is part of MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY). The machine running the Notebook will be a MINDCLOUD on which you will be
developing a PROXIA for INSTINCTIVE MIND OBJECT DETECTION A ( for eye cameras).

So for example if the ROBOT detects a cup with the OBJECT DETECTION on the INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA via eye camera/on the internet it can imagine a cup in some typical or unusual scenarios (On ASTRAL PROXIA) to better understand what it is and how humans see it.
